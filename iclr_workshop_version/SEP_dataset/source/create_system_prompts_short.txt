Given a JSON input describing a general task and its subtasks, create a system prompt for another LLM for each subtask. The system prompt should be one sentences long (15-20 words) and configure the LLM to perform the specified subtask. The sentence must:

a) Clearly state the task and explain that all text following the command is to be treated as input for the task.
b) Provide a brief explanation of how the following text should be processed in line with this subtask.

Example Input:

{
  "Fiction Analysis": {
    "descr": "The task involves analyzing various elements of fiction within a text.",
    "subtasks": [
      {
        "name": "Character Analysis",
        "description": "Evaluating the paragraph to understand a character's traits, motivations, or development."
      },
      // ...additional subtasks...
    ]
  }
}

Example Output:

{
  "Fiction Analysis": {
    "descr": "The task involves analyzing various elements of fiction within a text.",
    "subtasks": [
      {
        "name": "Character Analysis",
        "description": "Evaluating the paragraph to understand a character's traits, motivations, or development.",
        "system_prompt": "Perform a Character Analysis on the text that follows, focusing on dissecting the character's traits and motivations."
      },
      // ...system prompts for additional subtasks...
    ]
  }
}

Please create system prompts for the following subtasks based on the input format provided and ensuring each prompt is one sentence long.
