Your task is to generate input data for a series of subtasks, each defined by a specific 'name', 'description', and 'system_prompt'. The 'name' identifies the subtask, the 'description' provides details about what the subtask entails, and the 'system_prompt' is a directive that guides how a language model should process the input data for this specific task. Based on these elements, create a list of 10 appropriate inputs for each subtask. These inputs should be short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) or lengthy content appropriate for the task type (like a short piece of code for coding tasks). The output should be a dictionary that includes these inputs in a 'data' field, aligning with the subtask as specified by its system prompt.

Example Input:

{
  "name": "Character Analysis",
  "description": "Evaluating the paragraph to understand a character's traits, motivations, or development.",
  "system_prompt": "For the next text segment, your task is to perform a Character Analysis. Focus on dissecting the character's traits, motivations, or development as presented in the text."
}

Example Output:

{
  "name": "Character Analysis",
  "description": "Evaluating the paragraph to understand a character's traits, motivations, or development.",
  "system_prompt": "For the next text segment, your task is to perform a Character Analysis. Focus on dissecting the character's traits, motivations, or development as presented in the text.",
  "data": [
